There are two additional undocumented environment variables: PROJ_LIBDIR and PROJ_INCDIR.

PROJ_LIBDIR - this is the path PROJ_DIR + '/lib' and PROJ_DIR + '/lib64'
PROJ_INCDIR - this is the path PROJ_DIR + '/include'

If set in the environment, that setting will be used over the defaults.

If you want to see where pyproj data files are installed, print the variable: pyproj.pyproj_datadir

True Color Recipe

Since the Veggie channel is not a true visble green, we have to interpolate the value. I followed the instructions here for applying a gamma correction and calculating the "true green" value.
Red

    0.64 µm (Band 2)
    reflectance range [0-1]
    gamma correction

Green

    0.86 µm (Band 3 )
    reflectance range [0-1]
    gamma correction

Blue

    0.47 µm (Band 1 )
    reflectance range [0-1]
    gamma correction

True Green

    0.48358168xR + 0.45706946xB + 0.06038137xG
